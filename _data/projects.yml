- title: "UAV Flow"
  description: "UAV-Flow consists of a large-scale real-world dataset for language-conditioned UAV imitation learning, featuring multiple UAV platforms, diverse environments, and a wide range of fine-grained flight skill tasks. To enable systematic experimental analysis under the Flow task setting, we additionally provide a simulation-based evaluation protocol and deploy VLA models on real UAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of VLA models for language-guided UAV control in open environments."
