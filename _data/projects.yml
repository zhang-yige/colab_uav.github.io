- title: "UAV-Flow Colosseo: A Real-World Benchmark for Flying-on-a-Word UAV Imitation Learning"
  description: "UAV-Flow consists of a large-scale real-world dataset for language-conditioned UAV imitation learning, featuring multiple UAV platforms, diverse environments, and a wide range of fine-grained flight skill tasks. To enable systematic experimental analysis under the Flow task setting, we additionally provide a simulation-based evaluation protocol and deploy VLA models on real UAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of VLA models for language-guided UAV control in open environments."

- title: "Towards Realistic UAV Vision-Language Navigation: Platform, Benchmark, and Methodology"
  description: "We propose a realistic UAV simulation platform and a novel UAV-Need-Help benchmark. The OpenUAV platform focuses on realistic UAV vision-language navigation tasks, integrating diverse environmental components, realistic flight simulations, and algorithmic support. The UAV-Need-Help benchmark introduces an assistant-guided UAV object search task, where the UAV navigates to a target object using object descriptions, environmental information, and guidance from assistants."

- title: "AeroDuo: Aerial Duo for UAV-based Vision and Language Navigation"
  description: "We present DuAl-VLN, a novel framework where two UAVs collaborate at different altitudes—a high-altitude UAV for global reasoning and a low-altitude UAV for precise navigation—enabling efficient, autonomous flight guided by natural language. Powered by the HaL-13k dataset and our AeroDuo system, which combines a multimodal Pilot-LLM with lightweight navigation policies, this approach achieves a 15.7% higher success rate than single-UAV methods, demonstrating the power of collaborative aerial intelligence."

- title: "Hi AirStar, Guide Me to the Badminton Court."
  description: "AirStar transforms drones into smart aerial companions by integrating a large language model as its cognitive core, enabling natural voice and gesture control for intuitive interaction. It combines geospatial navigation with real-time reasoning for precise movement, while offering advanced features like question answering, automated filming, and target tracking. Designed for extensibility, AirStar paves the way for next-gen, instruction-driven UAV assistants."
